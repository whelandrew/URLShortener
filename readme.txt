URL Shortener
1.	A user should be able to load the index page of your site and be presented with an input field where they can enter a URL.
2.	Upon entering the URL, a "shortened" version of that url is created and shown to the user as a URL to the site you're building.
3.	When visiting that "shortened" version of the URL, the user is redirected to the original URL.
4.	Additionally, if a URL has already been shortened by the system, and it is entered a second time, the first shortened URL should be given back to the user.

10/21/2019 4:40 PM - Remove TinyUrl and build my own shortened generator using https://www.jsonstore.io/ as a temporary server.
